League of Legends is a team-based strategy multiplayer game officially released in 2009. It has been, and still is, one of the world's most popular and successful video games of recent decades. Each game in League of Legends begins with ten players, separated by two teams of five players each; it is one team of the two that will win. It has multiple major factors that affect the win ratio in the game which makes each game unpredictable as a player. However, we, as data analysts, can predict the general win ratio based on certain game features that affect how a game will be driven and the chance for which team will win that game, using related datasets. Further explanation is written in the Gathering Data section of this tutorial.

There are a lot of useful datasets published containing these factors due to the popularity of the game; we will use two of these datasets to define the relationship between the win ratio and the following factors of the game: wards, gold earned, wards destroyed, first blood, kills, deaths, assists, dragons, heralds, towers destroyed, total experience, total minions killed. What these factors mean and how they affect the game is further explained in the Gathering Data section for those who are not familiar with MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) video games.

This tutorial will analyze and experiment with the chosen datasets to provide useful pieces of information about how the win ratio varies depending on these factors in League of Legends.
