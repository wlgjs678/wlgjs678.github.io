                <h2>About Me</h2>
                I'm currently enrolled at UMD (College Park) as an undergraduate and am planning to graduate in Dec. 
                2023 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
                <br><br>
                - How I chose Computer Science:
                <br>
                I discovered that I'm interested in Computer Science while I was exploring various fields of studies 
                at Montgomery College for 2 years. I found it facinating that I can contribute to various types of industries 
                and societies with the knowledge and skills from Computer Science. Then, I set my academic goals 
                related to Computer Science. I graduated from Montgomery College with an Associate's Degree in 
                Compupter Science and transferred to the University of Maryland to study more in depth.
                <br><br>
                - What I'm planning to do:
                <br>
                I'm now aiming to receive a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science by Dec. 2023 and am pursuing my 
                career to become a software engineer. Currently, I'm working for 
                <a href="https://www.sociable.how/" id="sociable-ai" target="_blank">Sociable AI</a> as a backend developer 
                to expand my skills and adapt to a working environment, while I'm attending classes. I began this 
                job in Feb. 2023.
                <br><br>
                - What I like:
                <br>
                I like spending time with my friends and family, ATV riding, kayaking, watching movies/dramas, playing 
                video games, billiards, legos, and many more!
