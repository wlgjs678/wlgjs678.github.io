                            About me:
                        </li>
                        I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and I moved to the U.S. at the age of 14. Thanks to this, I'm bilingual. 
                        I'm planning to continue to live in the U.S. and am currently enrolled at UMD (College Park) as an undergraduate.
                        I anticipate to graduate in May 2024 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I'm also working for 
                        <a href="https://www.sociable.how/" id="sociable-ai" target="_blank"><b>Sociable AI</b></a> as a software developer 
                        to enhance my skills and gain hands-on experience. I began this job in Feb. 2023.

                            How I chose Computer Science:
                        </li>
                        I discovered that I'm interested in Computer Science while I was exploring various fields of studies 
                        at Montgomery College for 2 years. I found it facinating that I can make an impact on a large number of different 
                        industries and societies with the skills from Computer Science. Then, I set my academic goals related to 
                        Computer Science. I graduated from Montgomery College with an Associate's Degree in  Compupter Science and 
                        transferred to the University of Maryland to study further in depth.

                            What I'm planning to do:
                        </li>
                        I'm now aiming to receive a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science by May 2024 and am pursuing my 
                        career to become a software engineer.

                        I like spending time with my friends and family, ATV riding, kayaking, watching movies/dramas, playing 
                        video games, billiards, legos, and many more!

                    This is a mobile app that works with the Android OS. It is intended to enable social practice 
                    for children that have autism throughout the app. To ensure keeping it practical and accurate, 
                    this is collaborated with a behavior technitian that have direct experience with autistic kids.
                    Several features such as emotion generator, voice recognition, and image and text generator were
                    implemented to serve its purpose.

                    <h3>Parser and Lexer</h3>
                    Building this program allowed me to expand my knowledge beyond computer compilers.
                    Parser and lexer have key roles in building a compiler or other computer language tools.
                    This program is written in OCaml, and it involved understanding how parser and lexer work before compiler,
                    which was not easy. Essentially, a lexer would take inputs and convert them into a set of tokens that can be used by the parser,
                    which would generate a syntax tree. Both parser and lexer are strongly related and required absolute
                    coding without errors. Going through trial and error, a lot of time for the implementation of the program was spent
                    on debugging.

                    <h3>Town Map & Fastest Route Finder</h3>
                    I built a program that provides a town-wise map feature. It can display the map of a town and find the fastest route
                    possible using the dijkstra's algorithm. The program maintains a network of towns and the roads connecting them.
                    This was done by having two main data elements (towns and roads), one data structure (graph), and data manager.
                    The towns are vertices consisting of custom objects that I implemented in Java. The data structure
                    stores all the data necessary and the data manager would utilize these custom objects for the program.
                    This was one of the easiest programs to implement, but it strengthened my knolwedge of object-oriented programming.

                    <h3>Data Analysis and Visualization</h3>
                    This project was done by a group of people including myself. This project involves mainly data
                    analysis and visualization, and it has an interesting topic which is about one of the most
                    popular video games. Instead of playing the game, we wanted to make something useful out of the game this time.
                    The data shows how each factor of the game affects its players, which turned out to be quite accurate and useful.
                    <br><br>
                    The code is written in Python, and the data representation involves mathematical calculations and data
                    visualization using the Python's libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
                    The following images show the heatmap, histogram, and boxplot of the data:

                    This portfolio website itself is built by myself with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I chose to use the
                    free static server that is hosted through GitHub using github.io. While working on this website, I've used
                    JavaScript to handle the navigation bar at the top of the page, contact inquries, etc.
