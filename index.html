                        A little about me:
                    </li>
                    I was born in Seoul, South Korea, but I lived my life in different regions of the world: 
                    South Korea (9 yr), China (5 yr), California (4 mo), New Zealand (4 mo), Germany (3 mo), and now Maryland 
                    (8 yr - present). This helped me become quick in adapting to new environments and live with diversity.
                    <br>
                    I'm now planning to settle in the U.S. and am currently enrolled at UMD (College Park) as an undergraduate.
                    I anticipate to graduate in Dec. 2023 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I'm also working for 
                    <a href="https://www.sociable.how/" id="sociable-ai" target="_blank">Sociable AI</a> as a backend developer 
                    to expand my skills and gain hands-on experience. I began this job in Feb. 2023.

                        How I chose Computer Science:
                    </li>
                    I discovered that I'm interested in Computer Science while I was exploring various fields of studies 
                    at Montgomery College for 2 years. I found it facinating that I can contribute to various types of industries 
                    and societies with many skills from Computer Science. Then, I set my academic goals related to Computer Science.
                    I graduated from Montgomery College with an Associate's Degree in  Compupter Science and transferred to the 
                    University of Maryland to study further in depth.

                        What I'm planning to do:
                    </li>
                    I'm now aiming to receive a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science by Dec. 2023 and am pursuing my 
                    career to become a software engineer.

                        What I like:
                    </li>
                    I like spending time with my friends and family, ATV riding, kayaking, watching movies/dramas, playing 
                    video games, billiards, legos, and many more!

                    <h3>Mobile App Developement: Socially</h3>
                    This is a mobile app that works with the Android OS. It is intended to enable social practice 
                    for children that have autism throughout the app. To ensure keeping it practical and accurate, 
                    this is collaborated with a behavior technitian that have direct experience with autistic kids.

                    hosted through GitHub using github.io. While working on this website, I've used JavaScript to handle
